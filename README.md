# Quick Start Guide

To run the cloned codebase directly, you need to have composer installed.

1. Run `composer install` to install dependencies.
2. Make sure your web server and database server are running.
3. Make your own `.env` file in the project root, following the key name but not value used in [`.env.example`]

4. From there, any the following should work:
  - `php artisan serve` to run server
  - `php artisan test` to run test
